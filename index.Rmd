Goal:

> Conceptualize and measure populism in a way that takes into account the *multidimensionality* of the phenomenon.

## Challenges & Shortcomings

<center>

To study the populist phenomenon means...

--

to enter muddy waters.

</center>

--

<br>

**What is *populist* about populism?**

--

+ Organization?

--

+ Communication?

--

+ Ideology?

--
<br>

*All at once?*

--

<br>

=> Populism has a *"chameleonic"* character (Taggart 2000)

## Challenges & Shortcomings

1st Challenge: The never ending confusion


--

<br>

<center>

Populists are... 

--

right-wing. 

</center>

--

<br>

<center>

... <i>right?</i>

> *Cas Mudde has been influential in the literature, suggesting that populist philosophy is a loose set of ideas that share three core features: anti-establishment, authoritarianism, and nativism.*

## Challenges & Shortcomings


Populism as a *thin centered ideology* (Mudde & Kaltwasser 2017):

--

+ Two groups: *"pure people"* vs. *"corrupt elites"*

--

+ Politics should express *"volonté générale"* 

--

<br>


**But who are *the people*?**

.center[

Liberal/Illiberal?

]

.center[

... Progressive/Traditionalist.

]

## Data & Methods


**CHES Dataset**

Positions of 218 political parties in 22 European countries on european and national policy issues.

--

**Minimalist Definition of Populism**

+ *Salience of anti-establishment and anti-elite rhetoric*
+ *Euroskepticism (attitudes towards European integration)*

--

**Progressive vs. Traditionalist Populism**

+ *Green-Alternative-Libertarian (GAL) and Traditional-Authoritarian-Nationalist (TAN)*
+ *Position on social lifestyle (e.g. homosexuality)*
+ *Position on civil liberties vs. law and order*

### Data & Methods

**Merging with ESS (Round 5-8: 2010-2016)**

Two variables will be used to measure our *dependent variable*:

1. What party did you vote for in the last national election?
2. Which party is closest to your views?

--

**Resulting DV has three categories:**

Support for Establishment/Traditionalist & Progressive Populist Parties 

--

**Multinomial Regression:**

Independent Variables: 

*Economic Insecurity, Unemployment, Welfare, Anti-Immigration Sentiment, Age, Education, Sex, Left-Right Scale, Religiosity, Government Satisfaction, Trust in Global Governance, Rural vs. Urban, Regional dummies (East, West, North and Southern Europe) and temporal dummies (2010, 2012, 2014 and 2016)*

**Total: 68.403 respondents in 22 countries**

## Conclusions

---


## Conclusions

+ Results of Inglehart & Norris 2016 could mostly be reproduced

+ Conceptualization/Classification seems to be appropriate
    + should be checked/validated by others in the future
    + Eastern European Communist parties may represent special cases
    
+ Many missing values (include non-aligned in multinomial model?)

+ Future research should take the *multidimensionality* of populism into account
    + specifically avoid conflating right-wing populism with populism
